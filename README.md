# Markdown Previewer
This project is a simple React app that allows users to write markdown on an editor and preview the formatted result in real time. It is composed of three main files, a CSS file, a JavaScript file and an HTML file, all of them listed below.

## CSS
The CSS file contains the styles used to layout and format the app components. It sets up the background color, fonts, sizes, and margins for the previewer, editor and toolbar. It also defines the look of the formatted markdown elements.

## JavaScript
The JavaScript file contains the logic behind the app. It sets up a React component to render the app and to handle the markdown editor and the previewer components. It uses the marked.js library to parse the markdown text and render it as HTML.

## HTML
The HTML file is a simple structure that includes the app container and the root element where the React app will be rendered.
